        <p>
            The profile is the class that includes all the player data useful for the RPG game.
            It includes all the statistics you may encounter in the major part of the RPG games:
        </p>
        <list type="bullet">
            <li>
                Skills: strength, defense, etc...
                Class: tank, healer...
            </li>
        </list>
        <p>
            But for Mariko, it is different. Below, you will see the full list of each attribute.
