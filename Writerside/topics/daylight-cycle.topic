        <p>
            In <emphasis>Kimetsu no Yaiba</emphasis> universe, demons and humans cannot encounter except during the
            night.
            It becomes a problem when it comes to make a game where players can choose between demon and slayer ;
            and when they have to encounter each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve this problem, we set the daylight cycle mechanic.
            How it works?
            The daylight system decomposes itself in two versions: <control>solo</control> and
            <control>multiplayer</control>.

            As read above, activities are the way to switch the cycle. But, how do they work? Activities may have
            different impacts according to the time they can take. There is three groups:
        </p>
        <deflist type="medium">
            <def title="1. Full-day Activities">
                Activities taking a whole day <control>(12h~24h)</control> to being completed: long-distance travels,
                huge quest objectives.
            </def>
            <def title="2. Half-day Activities">
                Activities taking a half-day <control>(6h~12h)</control> to being completed: normal travels, normal
                quest objectives.
            </def>
            <def title="3. Short Activities">
                Activities taking a short time <control>(1h~6h)</control> to being completed: mini-games, environment
                interactions, short quest objectives.
            </def>
        </deflist>
        <p>The <control>displayed time</control> is written as in-game clock.</p>
        <p>
            Moreover, when a player is not doing an activity, the time on their world is passing as fast as real time
            (scale <control>1:1 - 24h/day</control>).

            The multiplayer map has its own daylight cycle system.
            This system is similar to the real-life one, but at a faster scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scale is <control>1:3</control>.
            In-game, the time passes <control>3 times faster</control>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since demons and humans are mixed in the map, the benefits of each race are the same as in the
