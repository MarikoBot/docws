    <chapter id="what-is-daylight-cycle" title="What is daylight cycle?">
        <p>
            In <emphasis>Kimetsu no Yaiba</emphasis> universe, demons and humans cannot encounter except during the night.
            It becomes a problem when it comes to make a game when players can chose between demon and slayer ; and when they have
            to encounter each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, to solve this problem, we set the daylight cycle mechanic. How it works ?
            The daylight system decomposes itself in two versions: <control>solo</control> and <control>multiplayer</control>.
